const AUTHOR_4 = "Gesenia Castle"
const COMMENT_4 = "I've been to many salons in Ottawa. This is the first place that did the most amazing job on the shaping and didnt mangle my cuticles. So many shellac colors to choose from. My acrylics are so strong and they actually used a good amount of acrylic as most places use the smallest amount in a thin barely there layer which results in breakage. They also didnt rush and took the time to finish the job properly paying attention to the shaping."
